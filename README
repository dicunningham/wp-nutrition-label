== Installation ==

1. Upload /wp-nutrition-label to the /wp-content/plugins directory

2. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress

3. In any posts or pages where you wish to insert a nutrition label, use the shortcode [nutr-label]. The shortcode accepts the following attributes:
   servingsize, servings, calories, totalfat, satfat, transfat, cholesterol, sodium, carbohydrates, fiber, sugars, protein, id, class, width

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What units do the attributes use? =

* Grams: totalfat, satfat, transfat, carbohydrates, fiber, sugars, protein
* Milligrams (mg): cholesterol and sodium
* Unitless: servings and calories (units are implicit for calories)
* You should include the unit in the serving size attribute (ie: "4 oz")

= What about Fat Calories? =

The **Fat Calories** number is computed from the totalfat attribute.

= How do I style the nutrition label? =

You can control the width with the "width" attribute. The width attribute uses **ems** as its unit. It is styled to scale but it's likely that the "Nutrition Label" text won't scale well as the default font is Helvetica, which isn't fixed-width.

You can specify the DOM ID of the enclosing **div** by setting the **id** attribute in the shortcode. You can also specify a CSS class by setting the **class** attribute. Then you can provide your own styling to change the label as you see fit.
